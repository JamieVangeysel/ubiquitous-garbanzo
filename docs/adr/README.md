# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for this project.

ADRs document **why** decisions were made, not just **what** was built.  
Code changes without context are how systems decay.

---

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions about:

- Technology choices
- System architecture
- Database schema design
- Authentication and authorization
- Messaging and real-time communication
- Cross-module boundaries

If the decision would be annoying to undo later, it deserves an ADR.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:
`ADR-XXXX-title.md`

And contains:

- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences

---

## Status Values

- **Proposed** – Under discussion
- **Accepted** – Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated** – No longer recommended
- **Superseded** – Replaced by another ADR
